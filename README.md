# Continuous Skills Development
As the Garages become larger, we are facing challenges in responding to growth and frequent change, just keeping up to date is becoming a full-time exercise.
But even so, it remains the responsibility of every Garage technical consultants to help drive our technical vitality through continuous growth in skills, giveback, and mentoring. 

We need to re-imagine how our Garages work. We want the Garages to transform themselves into a nexus point, bringing focus for our Garage technical consultants and supporting business and technical growth. This will ensure we stay relevant and able to meet the demands of the market.

## Skills Trinity - Our skills missions

### Badge Attainment and Career Plan
**Set Your Destination**
- "Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now." – Alan Lakein
- You want to establish a career destination for yourself over at least 2 years. Use this plan to inform your skilling and badging choices
- If unsure how to do this then get a career mentor

**Understand what will help you reach your destination**
- Establish a list a skills/badges that will help you to reach your destination
- Review this once a quarter to remind your of the destination to get reinvigorated and check that the destination is still indeed aligned to what you want
- Check each quarter for new badges that will help you t reach the destination

**Build and Execute a plan**
- From available options prioritize and establish a plan for badge and skill attainment
- Set goals and timeline for the plan and commit your checkpoint goals as additional motivation

### Know which badges will help you
There are a variety of badges but I tend to narrow them to 3 broader categories,  
- Knowledge badges typically simpler to attain but contribute to your broad knowledge base
- Skills or Experiential related badges require that you have worked or had practitioner experience typically to attain so make sure that you either have the skill or have a agreed work trajectory with your manager that will support this goal
- Career / Certification badges are more long term objectives that require deeper preparation and study so look at the requirement and build your plan around that, such badges often have dependent badges that need to also be attained 

### Badge – a call to action
1. Set yourself specific goals each quarter and give it the time and priority needed to achieve the goal
2. Agree the goals and make them **checkpoint** targets with your manager
3. Be realistic about what you can achieve blend a mix of Knowledge, Experiential, and Certification/Career badging
4. Do not feel constrained or limited to your pillar or what your know today especially when it comes to Knowledge badges
5. Do not do it alone when leaning new skills knowledge reach out and get a mentor or seek guidance from your manager
